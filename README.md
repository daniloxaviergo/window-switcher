# Window switcher (search) for Linux/ GTK+
A small app to search (by typing) through open windows and switch to them. Like `<Alt><Tab>`, but you type text. If you've ever used vimium for chrome, you'll love this.

## Dependencies
- The `wmctrl` command line tool
- GTK+ for python - https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html
- `tkinter`, which should come iwth your python installation
- `Python 3`

## How to use
`git clone` or download this repository, then bind `python3 <path-to-download> app.py` to some shortcut. On XFCE I use `<Ctrl><Alt>O`.

## FAQ
### Why is this such https://codecrap.com/?
Well, I wrote this in two hours during exam revision. Feel free to open a pull request.

### Halp! It doesn't work.
Check the dependencies. This thing works on dual monitors as well (checked). If it's still buggy, open an issue. I check them.. occasionally.
